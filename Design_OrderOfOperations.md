J Language Order of Operations
The J language has a fundamentally different order of operations compared to traditional programming languages:

1. Right-to-Left Evaluation
Unlike most languages that evaluate left-to-right, J evaluates expressions right-to-left. This is the core principle that governs J's order of operations.

Example:

2. No Traditional Operator Precedence
J does not use the traditional precedence rules (like "multiplication before addition"). Instead, it uses the "rightmost first" rule:

The rightmost function is applied first
Each function takes everything to its right as its right argument
This eliminates the need to memorize precedence tables for J's ~100 built-in functions
Example:

3. Parentheses Override Default Order
Parentheses work as expected and have the highest precedence, allowing you to override the right-to-left evaluation:

4. Monadic vs Dyadic Context
The same symbol can represent different operations depending on whether it's used:

Monadically (with one argument on the right)
Dyadically (with arguments on both left and right)
Examples:

5. Special Cases in Your Implementation
Looking at your test file, you can see this right-to-left evaluation in action:

6. Implementation in Your Parser
Your parser implements this right-associativity in the parse_expression method:

Summary
The J language's order of operations is:

Right-to-left evaluation is the fundamental rule
No traditional precedence - rightmost operations are performed first
Parentheses override the default order
Context determines function meaning (monadic vs dyadic)
Trains and adverbs/conjunctions follow special composition rules
This design makes J extremely consistent and eliminates the need to memorize complex precedence tables, but it requires programmers to think differently about expression evaluation compared to traditional languages.
